## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

Through JavaScript we have the ability to manipulate the DOM. Every single time you click on a button, the app is going to render the change through javascript and can see the change to the HTML in the browser.

## Lessons Learned:

The DOM API allows for  quick and efficient builds, it's a great tool for frontend/ UI experience!
The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. Usually it refers to JavaScript.

A document containing HTML is described using the Document interface, which is extended by the HTML specification to include various HTML-specific features. In particular, the Element interface is enhanced to become HTMLElement and various subclasses, each representing one of (or a family of closely related) elements.
